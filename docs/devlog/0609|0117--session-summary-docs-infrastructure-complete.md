# Session Summary: Documentation Infrastructure Complete

## Date: June 9th, 2025; 1:17am

**Status**: Session Complete  
**Tags**: #session-summary #documentation #strategy #infrastructure

## Session Overview
Major work session focused on creating sustainable documentation infrastructure for Gefest project. User about to clear context, so capturing all critical information.

## Current Project Status

### Payment Integration (Waiting Phase)
- **Backend**: ✅ Complete - Convex functions implemented for subscription management
- **Provider**: Payoneer (switched from Stripe due to geographic restrictions)
- **Status**: ⏳ KYC application submitted, waiting for approval
- **Next**: Once approved → integrate Payoneer Checkout SDK

### Business Strategy (Finalized)
- **Pricing Model**: 3-tier freemium
  - Free: $0 (1 project, 30-day history)
  - Pro: $5/month (5 projects, unlimited history, analytics)  
  - Unlimited: $11.20/month (unlimited projects, AI features, founder access)
- **Philosophy**: "1% daily progress" aligned with Atomic Habits
- **Conversion Strategy**: Project limits + history limits as upgrade triggers

### Alpha Launch Strategy (Ready to Execute)
- **Target**: Reddit communities (r/productivity, r/getmotivated, r/atomichabits)
- **Founder's Circle**: 50 alpha users, 6 months free Pro + direct founder access
- **Incentive**: Lifetime 50% discount for early adopters
- **Tasks**: Intelligence gathering, screening framework, Discord setup

## Documentation Infrastructure Achievements

### Structure Finalized
```
docs/
├── dev-log/           # Root level - easy access, project memory
├── about/             # Project context, foundations
├── features/          # Product capabilities (payment, calendar)
├── qbits/             # Ideation laboratory
│   ├── strategy/      # Business strategy (includes community engagement)
│   ├── workflow/      # Development optimization
│   ├── philosophy/    # Core beliefs & decorators
│   └── experiments/   # Learning from failures
└── av/               # Archive system
```

### Key Documents Created
- `docs/README.md` - Master documentation guide with taxonomy rules
- `docs/qbits/workflow/how-to-dev-log` - Development journal writing guidelines
- `docs/dev-log/index.md` - Navigation and format specifications
- Index files for all major sections with clear "what goes here" guidelines

### Critical Rules Established
- **Graduation Path**: qbits → features → archive (when mature)
- **Dev-log Triggers**: Major decisions, strategy pivots, feature completions
- **Current-time MCP**: Always use for dates (prevents hallucinations)
- **Taxonomy**: Features = product capabilities, Strategy = business approaches

## Technical Foundation (From Previous Sessions)

### Backend (Convex)
- Extended schema with subscription, payment, user limit tables
- Subscription management functions with plan enforcement  
- Payment tracking and webhook handling infrastructure
- HTTP endpoints ready for Payoneer integration

### File Structure
- `convex/schema.ts` - Extended with payment tables
- `convex/subscriptions.ts` - Plan management and limits
- `convex/payments.ts` - Payment tracking (ready for Payoneer)
- `convex/http.ts` - Webhook endpoint infrastructure

## What to Do During KYC Wait
1. **Frontend Development**: Build payment UI, subscription components
2. **User Experience**: Implement project limits, upgrade prompts
3. **Alpha Launch Prep**: Execute Reddit strategy, founder tasks
4. **Analytics Setup**: Conversion tracking, usage analytics

## Key Insights from Session
- **Documentation accessibility matters**: Dev-log moved to root level for frequent use
- **Clear taxonomy prevents confusion**: Strategy ≠ Features distinction critical
- **User feedback trumps assistant assumptions**: Founder knows project best
- **Current-time MCP prevents date hallucinations**: Always use for timestamps

## Documentation Workflow Established
- **Assistant auto-triggers**: Major decisions, pivots, completions
- **Format consistency**: MMDD|time--slug.md naming convention
- **Content structure**: Context → Decision → Impact → Next Steps
- **Tagging system**: #decision #strategy #technical #documentation #insight

## Business Context (Critical for Future)
- **Founder location**: Likely non-US (Stripe geographic restrictions led to Payoneer)
- **Target market**: Individual habit builders, not teams
- **Monetization philosophy**: Freemium with natural upgrade pressure
- **Community approach**: Reddit-first launch, founder accessibility

## Technical Next Steps (Post-KYC)
1. Install Payoneer SDK: `npm install @payoneer/checkout-sdk`
2. Update payment functions to use Payoneer IDs
3. Test webhook integration with ngrok
4. Deploy production webhook endpoint
5. Launch alpha with Founder's Circle

## Success Metrics to Track
- Free-to-paid conversion: Target 3-5%
- Trial-to-paid conversion: Target 15-25%
- Monthly churn: Keep under 5%
- Geographic performance with Payoneer
