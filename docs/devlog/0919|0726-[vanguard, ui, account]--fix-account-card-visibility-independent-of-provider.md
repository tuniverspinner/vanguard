### Context
User reported that the main Cline card (containing "View Billing & Usage" button) was missing from the Vanguard extension settings. Upon investigation, discovered that the `ClineAccountInfoCard` was only rendered when the selected provider was "cline", but account functionality should be independent of AI provider selection since billing/usage is not tied to which AI service is used for API calls.

### Decision & Work Done
**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Located issue in `webview-ui/src/components/settings/ApiOptions.tsx`
- Found conditional rendering: `{apiConfiguration && selectedProvider === "cline" && (<ClineProvider />)}`
- The `ClineProvider` component only contained the `ClineAccountInfoCard`
- This meant account card was hidden when users selected Groq or xAI providers

**Solution Implementation:**
1. **Moved ClineAccountInfoCard outside provider-specific rendering**
   - Removed conditional rendering of `ClineProvider`
   - Added `ClineAccountInfoCard` directly in main component
   - Made it always visible regardless of `selectedProvider` value

2. **Updated imports and component structure**
   - Added import: `import { ClineAccountInfoCard } from "./ClineAccountInfoCard"`
   - Removed import: `import { ClineProvider } from "./providers/ClineProvider"`
   - Replaced conditional provider rendering with direct account card rendering

3. **Code Changes:**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Only visible when Cline provider selected
   {apiConfiguration && selectedProvider === "cline" && (
       <ClineProvider currentMode={currentMode} isPopup={isPopup} showModelOptions={showModelOptions} />
   )}

   // After: Always visible
   {/* Cline Account Info Card - Always visible regardless of provider */}
   <div style={{ marginBottom: 14, marginTop: 4 }}>
       <ClineAccountInfoCard />
   </div>
   ```

### Impact
- **User Experience:** Account management (billing, usage, sign-up) now always accessible regardless of AI provider selection
- **Code Quality:** Removed unnecessary wrapper component (`ClineProvider`) that served no purpose other than conditional rendering
- **Architecture:** Better separation of concerns - account functionality is now properly independent of provider selection
- **Build Status:** âœ… TypeScript compilation successful, no breaking changes

### Next Steps
- User will test the fix to confirm account card appears for all providers (Cline, Groq, xAI)
- Monitor for any user feedback on the UI changes
- Consider if other account-related features need similar independence from provider selection

### Technical Notes
- Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Warning about "basename" export is pre-existing and unrelated to these changes
- The fix maintains all existing functionality while improving accessibility
- No breaking changes to existing API or component interfaces

### Lessons Learned
- Account/billing features should be independent of operational provider selection
- Conditional rendering based on provider type can hide important functionality
- Always test UI changes across all provider options, not just the default
