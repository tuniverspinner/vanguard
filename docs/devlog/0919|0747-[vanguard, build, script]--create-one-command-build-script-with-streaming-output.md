### Context
User requested a one-command build script that would compile the entire Vanguard extension with streaming output, including error handling. The existing build process required multiple manual commands and didn't provide clear feedback on build status or errors.

### Decision & Work Done
**Build Script Creation:**
- Created `bin/compile.sh` as a comprehensive build script
- Renamed from original `build.sh` to `compile.sh` for better naming accuracy
- Implemented streaming output with colored status indicators
- Added error continuation (doesn't exit on first error, continues through all steps)
- Fixed circular dependency issue in package.json scripts

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. **One-Command Build**: Single `./bin/compile.sh` command runs entire pipeline
2. **Streaming Output**: Real-time display of all build steps and their status
3. **Error Handling**: Continues through all steps even if one fails, shows exit codes
4. **Colored Status**: Green ✅ for success, Red ❌ for failures, Blue/Yellow for info
5. **File Detection**: Automatically finds and lists generated VSIX files

**Circular Dependency Fix:**
- **Problem**: `vscode:prepublish` → `npm run package` → `vsce package` → triggered prepublish again
- **Solution**: Changed `vscode:prepublish` from `npm run package` to `npm run compile`
- **Result**: Broke circular reference while maintaining functionality

**Package Name Update:**
- Changed package name from "bryne" to "vanguard" in package.json
- Updated displayName accordingly
- VSIX now generates as `vanguard-1.0.0.vsix` instead of `bryne.vsix`

**Script Structure:**
```bash
# Function-based approach for error handling
run_command() {
    eval "$cmd" 2>&1  # Stream both stdout and stderr
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}✅ ${step_name} completed successfully${NC}"
    else
        echo -e "${RED}❌ ${step_name} failed${NC}"
        return $exit_code
    fi
}
```

### Impact
- **Developer Experience**: Single command replaces 3-4 manual npm commands
- **Error Visibility**: All build output streamed in real-time with clear status
- **Build Reliability**: Continues through errors, providing complete diagnostic info
- **Package Naming**: Extension now correctly branded as "Vanguard"
- **Build Speed**: No redundant command execution (removed circular dependencies)

### Technical Notes
- **Streaming**: Uses `2>&1` to capture both stdout and stderr
- **Colors**: ANSI color codes for visual status indicators
- **Error Continuation**: Uses `set -o pipefail` but doesn't exit early
- **File Detection**: `find` command locates VSIX files anywhere in project
- **Circular Fix**: Separated prepublish from full package command

### Next Steps
- User will test the build script functionality
- Consider adding build timing information
- May want to add automated testing integration
- Could add deployment/publishing commands to the script

### Lessons Learned
- **Circular Dependencies**: VSCode prepublish hooks can create infinite loops
- **Error Streaming**: Important to capture both stdout and stderr for diagnostics
- **User Experience**: Clear status indicators improve developer workflow
- **Naming Consistency**: Package name should match project branding
