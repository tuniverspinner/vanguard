## Context

During implementation of xAI model integration (`grok-code-fast-1` and `grok-4-fast`), we discovered that xAI's API has extremely complex token accounting and pricing structures that differ significantly from our assumptions. This devlog documents the methodical testing journey and critical discoveries about xAI's billing system.

## Background

We began with a methodical approach:
1. **Mock Testing**: Comprehensive cost calculation validation
2. **Real API Testing**: Direct xAI API calls to validate assumptions
3. **Cost Verification**: Comparison of calculated costs vs actual dashboard billing

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Complex Token Accounting Structure

xAI provides ultra-detailed token breakdowns that go far beyond OpenAI's simple structure:

```json
"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 119,
  "completion_tokens": 9,
  "total_tokens": 226,
  "prompt_tokens_details": {
    "text_tokens": 119,
    "cached_tokens": 112
  },
  "completion_tokens_details": {
    "reasoning_tokens": 98
  }
}
```

**Breakdown**:
- **Prompt tokens**: 119 total (includes cached tokens)
- **Cached tokens**: 112 (separate accounting)
- **Completion tokens**: 9 (actual output text)
- **Reasoning tokens**: 98 (internal thinking, separate from completion)

### 2. Cost Calculation Discrepancies

Our initial cost calculations were **significantly wrong**:

| Metric | Our Calculation | Dashboard Reality | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Single request cost | $0.000061 | $0.0000125 avg | **387% overestimation** |
| Token accounting | Simple addition | Complex breakdown | **Fundamentally different** |

### 3. Pricing Structure Unknown

xAI's actual pricing appears to be much more complex than documented:
- **Reasoning tokens**: May be free, discounted, or separately priced
- **Cache tokens**: May have different pricing than assumed
- **Volume discounts**: Possible tiered pricing we haven't identified
- **Billing thresholds**: Very small amounts may not register properly

## Technical Implementation

### Test Infrastructure Created

**Location**: `suites/` directory
- **Vitest setup**: 3x faster than Mocha
- **Dual mode testing**: Mock + Real API
- **TypeScript support**: Full type safety
- **Environment gating**: `VITEST_COST_TEST=true` for real API calls

### Real API Test Implementation

**Direct HTTP calls** (no OpenAI SDK):
```javascript
// Endpoint: https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions
// Headers: Authorization: Bearer ${XAI_API_KEY}
// Request format matches xAI docs exactly
```

**Response validation**:
- Token structure validation
- Cost calculation comparison
- Dashboard spend correlation

## Current State

### âœ… Completed
- Mock test suite (12/12 passing)
- Real API connectivity
- Token accounting discovery
- Cost discrepancy identification

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Understanding xAI pricing structure
- Reasoning token pricing clarification
- Cache token pricing validation

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Easy Continuation Points)

#### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Test non-reasoning model**: Use `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning` to isolate reasoning token complexity
2. **Increase token volume**: Make larger requests to get measurable billing data
3. **Multiple data points**: Test different token volumes to understand pricing curve

#### Medium Priority
1. **Cache pricing validation**: Test with/without cached tokens
2. **Volume discount analysis**: Test different usage levels
3. **Billing threshold identification**: Find minimum chargeable amounts

#### Long Term
1. **Complete pricing model**: Document actual xAI pricing structure
2. **Cost function update**: Implement accurate calculation logic
3. **Model integration**: Add models with correct pricing

## Files Created

### Test Infrastructure
- `suites/xai-models.test.ts` - Complete test suite
- `suites/README.md` - Documentation
- `suites/run` - Execution script
- `suites/vitest.config.ts` - Configuration

### Analysis Scripts
- `analyze-xai-response.js` - API response analyzer
- `cost-analysis.js` - Cost calculation validator
- `xai-response.json` - Sample API response

### Documentation
- `suites/future.txt` - Future test roadmap
- This devlog

## Critical Insights

### 1. xAI â‰  OpenAI
xAI's API appears compatible but has fundamentally different internal accounting:
- **Reasoning tokens**: Separate from completion tokens
- **Detailed breakdowns**: Ultra-granular token categorization
- **Pricing complexity**: Likely different rates for different token types

### 2. Real API Testing Essential
Mock tests provided confidence but **real API tests exposed critical flaws**:
- 387% cost overestimation
- Complex token structures
- Billing threshold issues

### 3. Pricing Reverse Engineering Required
xAI's pricing documentation appears incomplete. Actual pricing must be determined through:
- Systematic API testing
- Dashboard spend correlation
- Volume-based analysis

## Recommendations for Continuation

### For Future Developer
1. **Start with non-reasoning model**: `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning` to isolate variables
2. **Use analysis scripts**: `analyze-xai-response.js` and `cost-analysis.js` for data collection
3. **Increase token volumes**: Make larger requests for better billing visibility
4. **Document findings**: Update this devlog with new discoveries

### Test Strategy
```bash
# Start with simple model
XAI_API_KEY=... ./suites/run --cost=true

# Analyze responses
node analyze-xai-response.js
node cost-analysis.js

# Scale up testing
# - Increase max_tokens
# - Test different models
# - Monitor dashboard updates
```

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes
- **Test infrastructure**: Robust, reusable testing framework
- **API connectivity**: Working xAI integration
- **Discovery process**: Systematic approach to complex problems

### Challenges Identified
- **Pricing complexity**: xAI billing much more complex than assumed
- **Documentation gaps**: Official docs don't cover detailed token accounting
- **Cost accuracy**: Current calculations significantly overestimate

## Conclusion

This journey revealed that xAI's pricing and token accounting is **significantly more complex** than initially assumed. The methodical testing approach successfully identified critical issues that would have caused major problems in production.

The "freakishly revealing" real API tests exposed fundamental flaws in our understanding, proving the value of direct API validation over assumption-based development.

**Status**: Testing infrastructure complete, pricing understanding in progress. Ready for continuation with non-reasoning model analysis.
