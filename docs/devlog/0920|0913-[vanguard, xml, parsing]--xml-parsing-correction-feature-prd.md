# Product Requirements Document: XML Parsing Correction Feature

## Executive Summary
This feature implements intelligent XML parsing correction to handle malformed tool calls from AI models, preventing conversation flow disruptions and enabling seamless self-correction.

## Problem Statement
Current XML parsing is brittle and fails on common formatting issues:
- Missing closing tags (`<read_file>` without `</read_file>`)
- Extra spaces in tag names (`<read_file> `)
- Incomplete parameter structures
- Malformed nested content

When parsing fails, the system shows error messages and requires user intervention, breaking the conversational flow.

## Solution Overview

1. Detects malformed XML before execution
2. Provides contextual guidance to the AI model

The modular architecture ensures maintainability, the comprehensive testing strategy ensures reliability, and the gradual rollout approach minimizes risk. Success will be measured by both quantitative metrics (correction rates, performance impact) and qualitative improvements (conversation flow, user satisfaction).

The feature aligns with our goals of creating more robust, user-friendly AI interactions while maintaining the performance and reliability standards expected in production systems.
